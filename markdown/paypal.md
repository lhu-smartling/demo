Website Payments Standard (WPS) provides payment buttons that buyers can use to pay for purchases. Merchants can use the buttons to securely accept credit card, debit card, and PayPal payments on their website.

## How it works 01

Use your PayPal Business website to create and customize a payment button. When you select **Create Button** on the Create PayPal payment button page, PayPal generates an encrypted button code. Copy and paste the HTML code snippet to your checkout page. After your checkout page display the payment button, make sure your button renders in the layout that you want.

## Buyer experience

Your buyers can see the payment button on the checkout page when theyâ€™re ready to purchase.

You must have a PayPal Business or PayPal Premier account to create payment buttons. There are no setup fees or cancellation fees. See [PayPal Merchant Fees](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees/) for information about per-transaction fees.
